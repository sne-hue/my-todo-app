# My Todo App 📝

Hi there! This is my **first Todo List app** built with **Next.js** and **React**.  
It’s a simple app where you can **add your tasks**, **mark them as complete**, and **delete them** when done.  

## Key Features 

- Add tasks with a **title** and **description**  
- Mark tasks as **Complete / Undo**  
- Delete tasks you no longer

## Tech Used 

- **Next.js**  
- **React**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **CSS**
  
## How it Works

Type a task in the input field and click Add Task
Tasks appear in the list below
Click Complete to mark a task as done (crossed out)
Click Undo to mark it incomplete again
Click Delete to remove a task
